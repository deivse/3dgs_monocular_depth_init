# TODO
- [x] RANSAC (MSAC)
- [ ] Adaptive sub-sampling
- [ ] Re-run experiments
- [ ] Make it run on CIIRC cluster
- [ ] Merging step
    - simple things eg kmeans clustering
    - agglomerative clustering of points
- [ ] Test on more data - tanksandtemples
- [ ] Write the thesis
- [ ] Profit

## What to test
- Try to add noise to depths (gaussian noise), see how much it impacts things
- Try running things with less downsamling -> Does the raw number of points help or number of points that are close to surfaces? 
- Try running things at higher resolution (are my images downsampled in current runs?) (Motivation similar to previous one)
